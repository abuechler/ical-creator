# Tools for Quality Assurance in Software Development

Add Eslint and maybe some other tooling to the workflows. Remember that the ical-creator.html shall not have any build
step. The linters should be run in the GitHub Actions workflows. Also improve the output in the GitHub Actions
summaries. Add summaries for:

- Test results (number of tests passed/failed)
- Linting results (number of issues found/fixed)
- Deployed versions (if applicable)
