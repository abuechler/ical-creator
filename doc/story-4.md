# Create a detailed GitHub Job Summary

- The summary should list all test cases (with short descriptions) that were executed as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- For each test case, indicate whether it passed or failed.
- If a test case failed, provide a brief explanation of the failure and any relevant error messages.
- Include a total count of test cases executed, along with the number of passes and failures.
- Format the summary in a clear and organized manner, using bullet points or a table for easy readability.
- If the online validator is used, provide screenshots and logs of the validation results.
- Add all iCal files that were generated during the tests as artifacts for further review.
