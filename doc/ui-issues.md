# UI Issues to fix

This document describes some UI issues that should be addressed.

- The "Preview" button has no real function since a calendar preview is always shown. Remove it.
- The "Download .ics" button should not be active until any validation errors are fixed. Give a hint that this is the
  case.
- The spacing between the "Download .ics" button and the "Add Event" and the Saved Events list is too small. Consider
  make it consistent with other vertical spacing.

Lets go through these list one by one before starting to implement them. Lets clarify them first, offer choices if
needed and offer suggestions. Summarize the the prompts and decisions in the section below.
