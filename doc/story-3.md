# Add tests and execute them via GitHub Actions

- Add a GitHub Actions workflow to run tests on each push and pull request.
- Make sure all tests in a certain folder are executed.
- Use playwright to create iCal files for various different event configurations and validate the generated files with an iCal validator.
- Use the iCal library https://www.ical4j.org/validation/ to test the files.
- Add a workflow option in case its manually triggered to test the files also with the online validator at https://icalendar.org/validator.html
