## Usage

Create your event, then download the generated .ics file. You can share it via email or messaging apps, and recipients can import it directly into their calendar application.

## Privacy

Your data stays private.

All data is stored locally on your device using your browser's localStorage. Nothing is sent to or stored on any external server.

This means:
- Your events are only accessible on this device and browser
- Clearing your browser data will remove saved events
- No account or sign-up required
