# Example: Direct Gemeinde Website

## When to Use

Sometimes the Ferienplan is published directly on the Gemeinde (municipality) website, not the school website.

## Example: Bülach

### Search Path

1. **Start:** https://www.buelach.ch
2. **Navigate:** Publikationen section
3. **Search:** "Ferienplan"
4. **Result:** Direct PDF download

### Why It Worked

- Bülach is the main town of the Bezirk
- Gemeinde website is comprehensive
- Ferienplan published as official municipal document

## When to Try This First

- Larger municipalities
- Towns that are Bezirk capitals
- Gemeinde websites with "Publikationen" or "Downloads" sections

## Signs to Look For

- "Bildung" section on Gemeinde website
- "Publikationen" or "Amtliche Mitteilungen" section
- Direct links to school information
