# Effort Estimates for Schulferien Data Collection

## Baseline: Bezirk Bülach

**Gemeinden:** 22
**Time spent:** ~2 hours (initial collection with full methodology documentation)

Breakdown:
- PDF collection & downloads: ~40 minutes
- Finding missing/difficult sources: ~20 minutes
- Creating per-Gemeinde source docs: ~30 minutes
- Creating methodology documentation: ~20 minutes
- Directory structure setup: ~10 minutes

**Result:** 19/22 PDFs downloaded, 2 webpage-only, 1 restricted

## Estimates for Remaining Bezirke

Subsequent Bezirke should be faster since methodology and structure are established.

**Estimated rate:** ~3-4 minutes per Gemeinde (after initial setup)

| Bezirk | Gemeinden | Estimated Time | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Affoltern | 14 | 45-60 min | |
| Andelfingen | 20 | 60-80 min | |
| ~~Bülach~~ | ~~22~~ | ~~2 hours~~ | ✓ Done (baseline) |
| Dielsdorf | 22 | 70-90 min | |
| Hinwil | 11 | 35-45 min | |
| Horgen | 9 | 30-40 min | |
| Meilen | 11 | 35-45 min | |
| Pfäffikon | 10 | 30-40 min | |
| Uster | 10 | 30-40 min | |
| Winterthur | 19 | 60-75 min | Larger city, may have more school units |
| Dietikon | 11 | 35-45 min | |
| Zürich | 1 | 15-20 min | City only, but many school units |

## Total Estimates

| Scope | Gemeinden | Estimated Time |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Remaining 11 Bezirke | 138 | 7-10 hours |
| All 12 Bezirke | 160 | 9-12 hours |

## Factors Affecting Time

**Faster:**
- Escola platform (consistent UI)
- Direct PDF links on school website
- Gemeinde website has Ferienplan directly

**Slower:**
- Custom CMS requiring exploration
- Shared Schulgemeinden (need to identify relationships)
- Restricted access (need to document alternatives)
- Webpage-only data (need to extract dates manually)

## Recommendations

1. **Batch by platform:** Group Escola-based schools together
2. **Start with smaller Bezirke:** Horgen (9), Pfäffikon (10), Uster (10) for quick wins
3. **Save Zürich for last:** Single municipality but complex (many school units)
4. **Parallelize:** Multiple Bezirke could be done in parallel sessions
